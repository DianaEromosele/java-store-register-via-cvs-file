This is a basic command-line app (built in Java) that imports a CSV file containing intel about store goods, their prices, and import status; and spits out a final grocery receipt that factors in sales tax.

How to get the app to run:

1.) In your command line, navigate to the folder that contains my file (The solution is in Java, so make sure you download a JDK (Java Development Kit) in order to run Java files from the command line.)

2.) From the command line, TYPE: javac *.java

3.) From the command line, TYPE: java Controller input_1.csv

(To import the data from the other CSV files, change the last part to "input_2.csv" or "input_3.csv" )
